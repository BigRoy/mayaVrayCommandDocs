#   The vrayformayaUtils package is a framework that eases the manipulation of v-ray data in your Maya scene.
#
#   It's currently being supported/managed by Colorbleed Animation Studios (www.colorbleed.nl)
#   Nevertheless you should look at this as a community effort so githubbers out there feel free to fork away! :)
