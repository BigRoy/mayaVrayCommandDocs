mayaVrayCommandDocs for DUMMIES
===============================

If you don't have a Technical Director in the studio or you're just looking for some quick and dirty scripts to help
you out in your V-ray for Maya workflow this is where you start. Welcome!


###Snippets (Quick Start)

Most likely the code snippets are the most interesting thing here if you're looking to get started quickly.
You can find them in the repository in the snippets directory. These are small scripts that don't require
any of the dependencies other than a standard Maya installation with V-ray for Maya.

####[V-ray for Maya code Snippets](snippets)

In short, you could copy the raw code of one of the snippets and paste it into the Maya script editor.
Note that all scripts here are written in **Python**, so make sure to run it in a Python tab.


####Get the scripts into your shelve.

You can middle-mouse drag the script from your script editor onto your Maya shelf to create an icon for it. You can
easily label, annotate and customize it by clicking on the small triangle on the shelf at the left of the screen, click
_Shelf Editor..._
