Documentation & Code Snippets for Maya's v-ray commands

###See the [Maya V-ray Commands Wiki](https://github.com/BigRoy/mayaVrayCommandDocs/wiki) for documentation.

We're trying to build up documentation for V-ray for Maya's code base. 

First focusing on all the built-in commands that come with a V-ray for Maya installation, like the extremely bad documented `vray` command.


###vrayForMayaUtils vs snippets


#####vrayForMayaUtils

The `vrayForMayaUtils` package contains functionality that allows TD's/Programmers to interact with V-ray in an
easier way. Currently this only helps managing v-ray attributes. Though we're working on building a _consistent
framework_.

On the to-do list is adding a framework around objectProperties and then we should have covered the two
main areas that benefit from automatisation. There might be a focus in the feature to do some (PySide?) GUI elements
that aid in the vray for maya workflow.

A couple of focuses for vrayformayaUtils are:

- Autocomplete for functions

- Consistent framework

- Possibly object oriented where suitable

- Fast and easy to use


#####snippets

On the other hand there are the `snippets`. You could consider that the quick stop for finding your script to deal with
a certain repetitive tasks. This is where you should go if you want to get started quickly.

I'll add some more example functions in the repository over time. With this we hope to share some of the knowledge that we've gained from using V-ray over time and the increasing need we had to improve the efficiency of our workflow.

Getting to a higher level of automatisation is closely related to understanding how to script your way through the basics. We are trying to help out on that part by sharing small code snippets focused on getting tasks done. By making this open-source we also hope to learn a lot from others and their ideas on the V-ray for Maya workflow.

*In the snippets section you can find some very useful code to help with fixing the v-ray for maya framebuffer bug.*

Also read the README_FOR_DUMMIES.md for more information.


###Help the Vray for Maya community

If you have any good documentation, tips or code snippets for Vray for Maya feel free to fork the repository and start adding away.
